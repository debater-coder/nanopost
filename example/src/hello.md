# hello

is it **_me_** you're looking for?

```rust
fn main() {
    // Check if it is me you are looking for
    if you.looking_for().contains("me") {
        println!("I can see it in your eyes");
        println!("I can see it in your smile");
    }

    me.wants.clear();
    me.wants.push("you");

    me.open_arms();
}
```
